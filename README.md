## Project overview: 
For my final project, I am building a social networking site with photos, an Instagram Lite of sorts. 
Users will be able to create profiles and post their content, and can also see other users' content and interact with it on their home feed. 

### Milestone 1 (complete)
1. Set up mongodb
2. Develop user and post schemas for backend
3. Code API routes

### Milestone 2 (complete)
1. Develop frontend pages for signup and login
2. Functionality for adding posts
3. Create home page feed

### Beyond MS 2 for final product
1. 'Like' feature for other users' posts
2. Profile component with pop up feature
3. Discover page with a list of all users
